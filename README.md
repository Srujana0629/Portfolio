### ❓ Why You Should Know Me

While most people focus on presenting a formal resume, I believe the story behind the scenes—the backstory of a person—is just as important.

Just like the ETL process in data engineering, where raw data is extracted, transformed, and loaded to uncover valuable insights, understanding someone's backstory helps connect the dots and reveals the "why" behind their journey.

Every story, like every dataset, holds something valuable waiting to be discovered.

### 🔍 What Made Me Choose Data Science?

During my undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I worked with IoT devices and used data science concepts to extract insights from hardware-generated data. This sparked my interest in Data Science.

I transitioned from hardware to analytics, where I now thrive—constructing efficient data pipelines, building data lakes, and optimizing data warehouses using a blend of programming and cloud technologies.

Along the way, I honed my skills in:
- **Leadership**
- **Data Management**
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Data Manipulation**
